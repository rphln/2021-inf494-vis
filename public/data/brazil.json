And since you can't play a 4k bluray on Linux using opensource sw I don't have a choice. If you could pay 1 eur for a drm free mkv of your favorite show in the best quality available the same time it airs and download it at max speed I and many others would do that. But I'm not paying 10 times for the same thing that's full of drm garbage.\n\nAlso downloading is legal here, upload is a civil matter and the methods used to catch people are illegal and any evidence obtained using them or derived from it inadmissible. So they can sue me, but they'd have to admit to breaking the law first. They'd lose the lawsuit since there would be no admissible evidence and they would be prosecuted for breaking the law. So.\n\nAlso I once bought a movie on itunes when it was released to support the actors\/creators\/... And it didn't play on anything but itunes which is a pile of trash, the subtitles were wrong half the time and it was in 720p despite being sold as 1080p. They fixed the resolution and subs. But it still doesn't play on anything but itunes. So I grabbed the torrent which had great subtitles, was in 1080p and the file could be played on anything fast enough to decode it. \n\nSaid movie has a tv show too. I bought the dvds but still torrented it because I found the torrents (took a month to download since the only seed was in Brazil and had very bad ul in almost hd (900p) and they never released in anything higher than dvd quality. And because it's just more convenient having it on your hard drive than on dvds. I don't even have enough sata ports to plug in a dvd player (board has 6, ssd + 5 hdds = 6 too).\n\nI bought a few games on gog to since there's no drm (bg1 and 2 ee) + they work on Linux\n\nI bought lotr extened edition too but I'm not going to pay for the blurays too since it the same movie at a higher resolution. If I bought the right to play said movie then I also bought the right to play it in a higher resolution. And besides since you can play 4k blurays on Linux with opensource sw.... and when you'll be able to do that, I'll be considered illegal because apparently you can play movies you bought on an operating system you want using the sw you want.

That article points out multiple times that not only did other candidates have the same opportunities Clinton did, all fundraising was geared towards the general, not the primaries.\n\nHere:\n\n&gt;In a letter to DNC members, Chairman Tom Perez noted that the party reached joint fundraising agreements with both Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"The joint fundraising agreements were the same for each campaign except for the treasurer, and our understanding was that the DNC offered all of the presidential campaigns the opportunity to set up a [joint fundraising agreement] and work with the DNC to coordinate on how those funds were used to best prepare for the general election.\"\n\nHere:\n\n&gt;A Democratic official who has reviewed the document pointed out that in addition to the Clinton signoffs Brazile characterized, it included language stating that \"nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process\" and that \"all activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary.\"\n\n&gt;The agreement also noted that the DNC \"may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.\" (Read the full memo below.)\n\nHere:\n\n&gt;Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook appeared on CNN Friday night and called \"laughable\" assertions that the agreement rigged the primary against Sanders. Among other things, he pointed to the fact that the memo states that joint efforts were to be focused on the general election.\n\n&gt;\"The DNC came to our campaign and said, 'We need help. We're not prepared for the general election,'\" Mook said. Regarding the fact that the memo gave the Clinton campaign a role in communications hiring, Mook added, \"The purpose of the DNC while a primary is going on is to hold Republican candidates accountable, and nobody was filling that post.\" He also insisted that the Sanders campaign had the ability to enter into a similar arrangement with the party.\n\n\nThe Sanders campaign's sole claim is that they didn't like the debate schedule.

I agree with your analysis that Brazil was a major factor, though some have concluded that SWK actually started building the temple to create this crisis in order to change the policy\/doctrine.  There is evidence that he worked with the Q12 individually over a 2-3 year period to try to get them all on board prior to making the change.  He was evidently very well informed regarding the schisms and tension following the 1890 manifesto and worked hard to avoid a similar situation.

Fez ruir um projeto continental de poder que uniu o PT, a Odebrecht e outras empreiteiras no financiamento de campanhas pol\u00edticas de esquerda e investimentos bilion\u00e1rios em Cuba. Fui testemunha do nascimento deste projeto em 1994, como enviado especial do Correio Braziliense ao Uruguai e Argentina para apurar as conex\u00f5es do PT com a esquerda latino-americana para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma multinacional da pol\u00edtica no continente com o nome fantasia de Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. A entidade foi viabilizada pelo ex-secret\u00e1rio de Rela\u00e7\u00f5es Internacionais do PT, Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia, morto em 20 de julho, embora a fama pelo empreendimento tenha ficado com Lula\n\n \u00a0\n\n A meta do Foro, criado em junho de 1990, era combater o neoliberalismo e criar uma hegemonia partid\u00e1ria e ideol\u00f3gica na Am\u00e9rica Latina, elegendo parlamentares e governantes. Chamava a aten\u00e7\u00e3o, durante a apura\u00e7\u00e3o da reportagem, o profissionalismo com que o projeto era conduzido. A comunica\u00e7\u00e3o exibia unidade de linguagem, com deputados e dirigentes sindicais de v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses afinados no mesmo discurso. Conforme o projeto avan\u00e7ava e governos iam sendo conquistados, como aconteceu no Brasil em 2002 com a elei\u00e7\u00e3o de Lula, surgia explosiva a mistura de ideologia, corrup\u00e7\u00e3o com a *compra dos advers\u00e1rios* \u2014 como ficou evidente no mensal\u00e3o e depois na Lava-Jato \u2014 e enriquecimento pessoal.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Hoje ficou comprovado que a Odebrecht funcionou como bra\u00e7o financeiro do PT para viabilizar um projeto de poder com a elei\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticos ligados ao Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Em troca, a empreiteira reinaria absoluta, como acabou acontecendo em v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses. Ao desbaratar o esquema de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o controlado pelo PT, a Lava-Jato lan\u00e7ou luz sobre o avan\u00e7o do Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo no continente e o papel de arrecadadora e distribuidora de dinheiro da Odebrecht, oferecendo aos parceiros do partido marketing pol\u00edtico de primeira linha \u2014 inicialmente com Duda Mendon\u00e7a e depois com Jo\u00e3o Santana \u2014, plano de governo com obras caras e assessoria para o financiamento dessas obras, muitas das quais receberam recursos do BNDES.\n\n Em junho de 1994, recebi um telefonema do advogado paulista Jos\u00e9 Carlos Gra\u00e7a Wagner, que me deu detalhes sobre o Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Ele jurava que o Foro, criado pelo PT, tinha a finalidade de integrar a esquerda latino-americana e financiar a elei\u00e7\u00e3o de Lula e outros l\u00edderes latino-americanos e at\u00e9 africanos. Investiguei o assunto e confirmei a hist\u00f3ria. Marcamos uma conversa no escrit\u00f3rio de Gra\u00e7a Wagner, em S\u00e3o Paulo, na Alameda Canuri, 72, Indian\u00e1polis\n\n .\n\n Anticomunista ferrenho, beirando os 70 anos, elegante, inteligente e culto, Gra\u00e7a Wagner sabia tudo sobre o Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo: \u201cEles n\u00e3o querem vencer s\u00f3 no Brasil, querem o poder em toda a Am\u00e9rica Latina. Pretendem financiar esse projeto com *dinheiro p\u00fablico*\u201d. Deu nomes, datas e uma informa\u00e7\u00e3o surpreendente para aquela \u00e9poca: dirigentes do Foro em outros pa\u00edses estavam conectados com o PT de S\u00e3o Paulo por uma rede internacional de computadores.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Fui para o Uruguai e consegui confirmar a hist\u00f3ria de Jos\u00e9 Carlos Gra\u00e7a Wagner. Cheguei at\u00e9 o deputado Jose Bayard, da Vertente Artiguista da Frente Ampla. No seu gabinete no Congresso, *havia um computador ligado em rede com S\u00e3o Paulo, pelo qual se comunicava com a dire\u00e7\u00e3o nacional do PT em tempo real. \u201cVamos ampliar isso\u201d, garantiu o deputado. Fiquei impressionado. Numa \u00e9poca em que os celulares eram uma novidade car\u00edssima e a internet engatinhava, uma rede privada internacional de computadores era algo no m\u00ednimo ousado*.\n\n \u00a0",
